# MyReads Project

----


#### Summary

This is a Reactjs based web application that allows the user to organize the books they have read by making a few clicks. It also has a search page for adding more books into the user's "bookshelf". The web application was coded from the Create-React-App and the Udacity's starter code template. Many features were implemented, such as making the book have a "state" of which bookshelf it was in, integrating a method to change shelves and update the Back-end, and etc.

#### Getting Started

To Install this web application and see it in action:

-  Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-  Start the development server with `npm start`

##### Note
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so please refer to the SEARCH_TERMS.md file to get a glimpse of the search terms.
